### 🔵 **Core Implementation Files**

#### 1. **`mlh_corrected.ipynb`** ⭐ (Main File)
**Type**: Jupyter Notebook (Complete Implementation)  
**Size**: 26 cells  
**Purpose**: End-to-end ML pipeline for Hangman agent

**Contents**:
- **Cell 1-5**: Setup, imports, dependencies
  - Libraries: numpy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, tqdm
  - Random seeds for reproducibility (seed=42)

- **Cell 6-8**: Data Loading & Preprocessing
  - Loads `corpus.txt` (23,923 training words)
  - Loads `test.txt` (2,000 test words)
  - Visualizes word length distribution and letter frequencies
  - Organizes words by length for efficient lookup

- **Cell 9-10**: Hidden Markov Model (HMM) Construction ✅
  - **4 Scoring Strategies**:
    1. Pattern Matching: Filters corpus words matching current pattern
    2. Position-Specific Analysis: Letter freq for each position/length
    3. Bigram Context: Letter co-occurrence patterns
    4. Length-Specific Frequencies: Different distributions per word length
  - **Adaptive Weighting**: Adjusts strategy based on game progress
  - Pre-computes all statistics for fast inference

- **Cell 11-12**: Hangman Game Environment ✅
  - Simulates the game with 6 lives (standard rules)
  - Tracks masked word, guessed letters, lives remaining
  - **Reward Structure**:
    - Correct guess: +10 × occurrences
    - Win: +150 + (10 × lives remaining)
    - Wrong guess: -20
    - Repeated guess: -20
    - Loss: -100

- **Cell 13-14**: Reinforcement Learning Agent (Q-Learning) ✅
  - **State Representation**: (length, pattern, lives, progress, has_vowel, num_blanks)
  - **Hybrid Decision-Making**:
    - 25-35% Q-values (learned experience)
    - 50% HMM predictions (pattern matching)
    - 10-15% Letter frequency
    - 10-15% Strategic bonuses
  - **Strategic Phases**:
    - Early: Prioritize vowels (E, A)
    - Mid: Ensure vowel coverage + patterns
    - Late: Position-specific + risk management

- **Cell 15-16**: Training Pipeline ✅
  - **15,000 Episodes** with curriculum learning
  - **3 Phases**:
    - Phase 1 (0-30%): Easy words (length 4-6)
    - Phase 2 (30-70%): Mixed difficulty
    - Phase 3 (70-100%): All words + problem word replay
  - Adaptive epsilon decay (exploration vs exploitation)
  - Problem word tracking and focused practice
  - **Current Status**: Training completed ✅

- **Cell 17-18**: Training Visualization ✅

    - Games Won: 580/2000
    - Avg Wrong Guesses: 5.326
    - Avg Repeated Guesses: 0.0 (excellent!)

- **Cell 21-22**: Results Visualization ✅
  - Win/Loss distribution
  - Wrong guesses histogram
  - Score breakdown charts

- **Cell 23-24**: Optional Fine-Tuning

- **Cell 25-26**: Save Results ❌ (Has pickle error)
  - Attempts to save trained agent
  - **Issue**: `AttributeError` with lambda functions in defaultdict
  - **Solution Needed**: Convert defaultdicts to regular dicts before pickling
